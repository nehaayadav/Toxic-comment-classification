# Toxic Comment EDA + Feature Engineering

This project is based on the **Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge** dataset.  
It focuses on:
- Basic dataset introduction (shape, duplicates, missing values)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering (manual features + sentiment features)  
- Advanced text encodings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe)  
- High-dimensional visualization (t-SNE)

### Dataset
- 159,571 Wikipedia comments
- 6 labels: toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate

### Key Insight
The dataset is **highly imbalanced**. Most comments are non-toxic, while *threat* and *identity_hate* are very rare.
